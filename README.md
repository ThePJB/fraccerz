## Fraccerz 


Its a fully sick fractal program


shift click to zoom in


ctrl click to zoom out


$$ z = \frac{z^2}{(z + 0.01i)(z - 0.02i)} + c$$
![plz work](https://github.com/kennoath/fraccerz/blob/99aa8502b71836cd287c4954f30f709e534e44d9/f1.png)

$$ z = \frac{z^2}{(z + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}i})(z - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i)} + c$$
![plz work](f2.png)


protip: if you want to move around quick make the window small


# TODO
- antialiased screenshot taker
- SIMD
- radix option might make it faster?? if the overhead of the mpmc is stupid
- storing what z got up to? maybe faster
