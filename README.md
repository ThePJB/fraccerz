## Fraccerz 
$$ z = \frac{z^2}{(z + 0.01i)(z - 0.02i)} + c$$

$$ z = \frac{z^2}{(z + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}i})(z - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i)} + c$$
![plz work](https://github.com/kennoath/fraccerz/blob/master/f2.png "plz work")


Its a fully sick fractal program

ctrl click to zoom out


protip: if you want to move around quick make the window small


# TODO
- antialiased screenshot taker
- SIMD
- radix option might make it faster?? if the overhead of the mpmc is stupid
- storing what z got up to? maybe faster
